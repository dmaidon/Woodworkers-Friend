# Safety Calculators - Quick Reference

## Router Bit Speed Calculator

### Formula
```
RPM = (Surface Speed × 12) / (π × Diameter)
```

### Quick Guide
| Bit Diameter | Max Safe RPM @ 9000 ft/min | Max Safe RPM @ 12000 ft/min |
|--------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| 1/4"         | 137,509                   | 183,346                    |
| 1/2"         | 68,755                    | 91,673                     |
| 1"           | 34,377                    | 45,836                     |
| 1.5"         | 22,918                    | 30,558                     |
| 2"           | 17,189                    | 22,918                     |
| 2.5"         | 13,751                    | 18,335                     |
| 3"           | 11,459                    | 15,279                     |
| 3.5"         | 9,822                     | 13,096                     |

### Safety Limits
- ✅ **< 22,000 RPM** - Safe range
- ⚠️ **22,000-24,000 RPM** - Caution
- 🛑 **> 24,000 RPM** - Dangerous, do not use

## Blade Height Recommendations

### Quick Reference
| Operation | Blade Height Above Material | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------------------|---------|
| **Ripping** | 1/8" to 1/4" | Minimize kickback, reduce exposure |
| **Crosscutting** | 1/4" (full tooth) | Clean cut, reduce tearout |
| **Dado/Groove** | 1/32" (just through) | Precise depth control |
| **Thin Stock** | 1/16" | Extra safety for < 1/4" material |

### Material Thickness Examples
| Material | Typical Thickness | Ripping Height |
|----------|------------------|----------------|
| 1/8" hardboard | 0.125" | 0.1875" - 0.1875" |
| 1/4" plywood | 0.25" | 0.375" - 0.4375" |
| 3/4" lumber | 0.75" | 0.875" - 1.0" |
| 2x4 (actual) | 1.5" | 1.625" - 1.75" |

## Push Stick Requirements

### Risk Assessment Matrix
| Stock Width | Stock Thickness | Risk Level | Requirements |
|-------------|----------------|------------|--------------|
| < 3" | Any | **CRITICAL** | 2 push sticks, push block, featherboards MANDATORY |
| Any | < 0.5" | **CRITICAL** | 2 push sticks, push block, featherboards MANDATORY |
| 3"-6" | < 0.75" | **HIGH** | Push stick MANDATORY, featherboards highly recommended |
| 6"-12" | 0.75"+ | **MODERATE** | Push stick for last 12", guard recommended |
| 12"+ | 0.75"+ | **LOW** | Push stick for final pass, standard precautions |

### The 6-Inch Rule
**NEVER let your hands come within 6 inches of the blade while it's running.**

### Critical Safety Zones
- **Red Zone (0-3")** - Blade to stock - NEVER put hands here
- **Yellow Zone (3-6")** - High risk - Use push devices only
- **Green Zone (6"+)** - Safe hand placement

## Dust Collection CFM Requirements

### Quick Reference by Tool
| Tool | Minimum CFM | Recommended CFM | Port Size |
|------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Table Saw** | 350 | 450-650 | 4" |
| **Router Table** | 200 | 300-400 | 2.5"-4" |
| **Miter Saw** | 400 | 500-700 | 2.5"-4" |
| **Planer (portable)** | 400 | 600 | 4" |
| **Planer (stationary)** | 600 | 800-1000 | 4"-6" |
| **Jointer (6")** | 350 | 500 | 4" |
| **Jointer (8")** | 500 | 600-750 | 4"-6" |
| **Bandsaw** | 200 | 300-450 | 4" |
| **Drum Sander** | 600 | 800-1200 | 4"-6" |
| **Thickness Sander** | 800 | 1000-1500 | 6" |

### Duct Loss Factors
| Component | Equivalent Length Loss |
|-----------|----------------------|
| 90° Elbow | ~5 feet |
| 45° Elbow | ~3 feet |
| Y-Connector | ~2 feet |
| Blast Gate | ~1 foot |
| Flex Hose (per 10') | ~15% CFM loss |

### Formula
```
Base CFM = Port Area (sq ft) × 4000 FPM × Tool Multiplier
Adjusted CFM = Base CFM × (1 + Duct Length / 100)
```

### Air Velocity Standards
- **4,000 FPM** - Standard for wood dust (heavy particles)
- **3,500 FPM** - Minimum to keep dust moving
- **4,500+ FPM** - Fine dust applications

- ☐ Dust mask/respirator on
- ☐ No jewelry, loose clothing, or gloves
- ☐ Long hair tied back
- ☐ Adequate lighting
- ☐ Clear workspace
- ☐ Outfeed support ready
- ☐ Dust collection running

### Tool Setup
- ☐ Blade/bit is sharp and undamaged
- ☐ Blade/bit properly installed and tightened
- ☐ Blade guard in place (unless operation requires removal)
- ☐ Fence or miter gauge secured
- ☐ Push sticks within reach
- ☐ Featherboards positioned (if needed)
- ☐ Zero-clearance insert (if needed)

### Mental Preparation
- ☐ Well-rested and alert
- ☐ No distractions or interruptions
- ☐ Clear plan for the cut
- ☐ Dry run without power to visualize
- ☐ Know where your hands will be at all times
- ☐ Escape plan if something goes wrong

### Post-Operation
- ☐ Wait for blade/bit to stop before removing workpiece

## Emergency Procedures

### If Kickback Occurs
1. **Let go of the workpiece** - Don't fight it
2. **Step aside** - Don't be in line with the projectile
3. **Turn off saw immediately**
4. **Inspect workpiece and blade** for damage
5. **Identify cause** before continuing

### If Injury Occurs
1. **Turn off tool immediately** - Emergency stop
2. **Apply direct pressure** to bleeding
3. **Call for help / 911** for serious injuries
4. **Keep first aid kit accessible** in shop
5. **Don't work alone** if possible

### If Blade Binds
1. **Turn off saw** - Don't try to force it
2. **Wait for blade to stop completely**
3. **Unplug the saw**
4. **Carefully remove workpiece**
5. **Check alignment and setup** before restarting

## Key Takeaways

### Router Safety
- **Large bits = Low RPM** - Never exceed manufacturer specifications
- **Variable speed router essential** for bits > 2" diameter
- **Inspect bits before use** - Cracks can cause catastrophic failure

### Saw Safety
- **Blade height matters** - Follow operation-specific recommendations
- **Push sticks save fingers** - Use them religiously
- **Guards are there for a reason** - Keep them in place

### Dust Collection
- **Your lungs can't filter wood dust** - They're not designed for it
- **CFM is crucial** - Undersized collectors are worthless
- **Fine dust is invisible** - And most dangerous

**Remember: You can always make another cut, but you can't make another finger. Work safe!** 🪚✋
