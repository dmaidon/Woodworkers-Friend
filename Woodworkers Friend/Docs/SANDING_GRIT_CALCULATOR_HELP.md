# Sanding Grit Progression Calculator - Complete Documentation

## Overview

The Sanding Grit Progression Calculator is a specialized tool within Woodworker's Friend that helps you determine the optimal sequence of sandpaper grits for achieving professional-quality smooth finishes on your woodworking projects.

## Why Grit Progression Matters

### The Science of Sanding
Each sandpaper grit creates scratches in the wood surface. The goal of progressive sanding is to replace deep scratches with progressively finer ones until they become invisible to the eye. Skipping grits can leave scratches that show through your finish, while using too many grits wastes time and sandpaper.

### Common Mistakes
1. **Skipping Too Many Grits:** Leaves visible scratches
2. **Starting Too Fine:** Takes forever to remove imperfections
3. **Ending Too Coarse:** Finish looks rough or cloudy
4. **Not Cleaning Between Grits:** Old grit particles create new scratches

## Getting Started

### Location
Navigate to: **References Tab → Sanding Tab**

### Interface Overview
The calculator is split into two panels:
- **Left Panel:** Input controls for wood type, grits, and progression method

### 4. Progression Type

#### Sequential (Thorough) Method
**Description:**
Uses every grit in the standard sequence between start and finish.

**Example:**
```
80 → 100 → 120 → 150 → 180 → 220
```

**Advantages:**
- ✓ Best finish quality
- ✓ Each grit removes previous scratches completely
- ✓ Recommended for clear finishes
- ✓ Reveals grain figure best
- ✓ Professional results

**Disadvantages:**
- ✗ Takes more time
- ✗ Uses more sandpaper
- ✗ More steps to track

**Best For:**
- Clear finish projects
- Natural wood showcases
- Fine furniture
- Projects where finish quality is critical
- Hardwood with beautiful grain

**Time Estimate:** 3-5 minutes per grit

#### Skip-Grit (Fast) Method
**Description:**
Skips every other grit in the sequence (keeps first and last).

**Example:**
```
80 → 120 → 180 → 220
```

**Advantages:**
- ✓ Faster process
- ✓ Uses less sandpaper
- ✓ Fewer steps
- ✓ Good enough for many applications

**Disadvantages:**
- ✗ May leave visible scratches
- ✗ Not suitable for clear finishes
- ✗ Can show through stain
- ✗ Requires careful inspection

**Best For:**
- Painted surfaces
- Heavily stained wood (dark stains)
- Utilitarian projects
- Time-sensitive work
- Projects where finish perfection isn't critical

**Caution:** Always inspect for cross-grain scratches between grits

**Time Estimate:** 3-5 minutes per grit (fewer grits = faster overall)

## The Calculation Process

### Standard Grit Sequence
The calculator uses the industry-standard grit progression:
```
40 → 60 → 80 → 100 → 120 → 150 → 180 → 220 → 320 → 400 → 600
```

### How It Works

## Best Practices

### General Sanding Guidelines

#### Before You Start
1. ✓ Check wood for nails, staples, or embedded grit
2. ✓ Ensure wood is flat (use plane/jointer if needed)
3. ✓ Identify grain direction
4. ✓ Have all grits ready
5. ✓ Set up dust collection
6. ✓ Test finish on scrap piece

#### During Sanding
1. ✓ Always sand with the grain
2. ✓ Use consistent, even pressure
3. ✓ Keep sander moving
4. ✓ Check for cross-grain scratches
5. ✓ Clean surface between grits (vacuum + tack cloth)
6. ✓ Inspect work in good lighting

#### After Each Grit
1. ✓ Vacuum surface thoroughly
2. ✓ Wipe with tack cloth
3. ✓ Inspect for remaining scratches
4. ✓ Check for cross-grain marks
5. ✓ Feel surface for rough spots

### Softwood-Specific Techniques

#### Pressure Control
- Use lighter pressure than with hardwood
- Let the sander do the work
- Avoid dishing (creating low spots)
- Watch for heat buildup

#### Raised Grain
- Expect grain to raise after first grit
- Can lightly dampen surface with water
- Let dry completely
- Sand again with same grit
- Helps prevent raised grain in finish

#### End Grain
- Requires finer grits (go 2 grits higher)
- More susceptible to tear-out
- May need sanding sealer

### Hardwood-Specific Techniques

#### Mill Marks
- Check carefully before starting
- May need card scraper
- Starting grit must remove them
- Once gone, don't come back

#### Grain Figure
- Higher final grits reveal more figure
- Important for prized woods like walnut, cherry
- 220+ recommended for showcase pieces

#### Dense Woods
- May require more aggressive starting grit
- Can handle more pressure
- Less concerned about dishing

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I really skip grits safely?
**A:** For painted surfaces on hardwood, yes. For clear finishes or softwood, use Sequential method for best results.

### Q: What if I don't have the exact grit listed?
**A:** Use the closest available grit. One grit off won't matter much. Don't skip two or more grits.

### Q: How do I know when to move to the next grit?
**A:** When all scratches from the previous grit are removed. Check in good lighting at an angle.

### Q: Should I sand between stain coats?
**A:** Usually no. Sand before staining (220 typical), then apply all stain coats. Sand between clear coats only.

### Q: Can I start too fine?
**A:** Yes. If starting grit doesn't remove imperfections, you'll waste time. Start coarser, work up.

### Q: How often should I change sandpaper?
**A:** When it stops cutting efficiently or clogs. Power sanders: every few minutes. Hand: varies greatly.

### Q: What's the highest grit I need?
**A:** For bare wood, 220 is typically the highest. Higher grits (320-600) are for between finish coats only.

### Q: Do I really need dust collection?
**A:** Yes. Wood dust is a serious health hazard. At minimum, use a dust mask and work in a well-ventilated area.
