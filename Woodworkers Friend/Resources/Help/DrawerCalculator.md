# Drawer Calculator

Calculate perfectly proportioned drawer heights for cabinets, dressers, and furniture using various mathematical progressions.

## Why Use Mathematical Progressions?

Rather than equal-height drawers, mathematical progressions create:
- **Better aesthetics** - Visually balanced proportions
- **Improved function** - Larger drawers at bottom for heavy items
- **Classic design** - Traditional furniture-making principles
- **Professional results** - Calculated, not guessed

## Inputs

### Cabinet Dimensions
- **Total Height** - Available space for all drawers (excluding spacing)
- **Drawer Count** - Number of drawers in stack
- **Drawer Spacing** - Gap between drawers (typically 0.5" - 1.0")
- **Drawer Width** - Face width (for visualization)

### Progression Types

Choose how drawer heights change from top to bottom:

#### **Uniform** - All Equal
- Every drawer same height
- Simple, modern aesthetic
- Best for: Identical contents, minimalist designs

#### **Golden Ratio** - φ (1.618:1)
- Each drawer 1.618x taller than the one above
- Naturally pleasing proportions
- **Most Popular** - Classic furniture choice

#### **Arithmetic** - Linear Increase
- Add same amount to each drawer
- Example: 4", 5", 6", 7"
- Predictable, straightforward
- Best for: Gradual height change

#### **Geometric** - Exponential Growth
- Multiply each by constant factor
- Example with 1.5x: 3", 4.5", 6.75", 10.13"
- Dramatic size change
- Best for: Tool chests, specialized storage

#### **Fibonacci** - Nature's Sequence
- Each = sum of previous two (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8...)
- Organic, natural feel
- Best for: Artistic pieces

#### **Reverse Arithmetic** - Largest at Top
- Opposite of arithmetic
- Uncommon but useful for specific applications
- Example: Appliance garages, drop-front desks

#### **Logarithmic** - Slower Growth
- Increases slow down over height
- More balanced than geometric
- Best for: 5+ drawer stacks

#### **Exponential** - Faster Growth
- Accelerating increase
- Extreme proportions
- Best for: Specialized tool storage

#### **Hambridge (Dynamic Symmetry)**
- Based on √2, √3, √5 ratios
- Classical design proportions
- Best for: Fine furniture, show pieces

#### **Custom Ratio**
- Specify your own multiplier
- Full control over proportions
- Best for: Matching existing pieces

## Using Presets

Quick-start buttons for common scenarios:

### Furniture Presets
- **Kitchen Standard** - Typical kitchen base cabinet
- **Office Desk** - Standard desk drawer configuration
- **Bathroom Vanity** - Vanity cabinet proportions
- **Custom Cabinet** - User-defined starting point

### Progression Presets
- **Golden Ratio** - Most common choice
- **Uniform** - All equal heights
- **Arithmetic** - Linear progression
- **Geometric** - Exponential growth
- **Fibonacci** - Natural sequence
- **Logarithmic** - Controlled growth
- **Exponential** - Rapid growth
- **Custom** - Your own ratio

## Understanding Results

### Individual Drawer Heights
Table shows each drawer:
- **Number** - Drawer position (top to bottom)
- **Height** - Calculated dimension
- **Ratio** - Proportion relative to smallest drawer
- **Cumulative** - Running total height

### Summary Stats
- **Total Height** - Sum of all drawer heights
- **Total Material** - Drawer heights + spacing
- **Average Height** - Mean drawer height
- **Height Ratio** - Largest : Smallest drawer ratio

- Proportional representation
- Easy visual verification

## Tips & Best Practices

### Choosing Progression Type

**Golden Ratio** - Best general choice
- Time-tested, proven proportions
- Works for 3-7 drawers
- Professional appearance

**Uniform** - When to use:
- Modern, minimalist design
- Identical drawer contents
- Maximum storage efficiency

**Arithmetic** - When to use:
- Gentle height change
- 4-6 drawers
- Predictable layout

**Geometric/Fibonacci** - When to use:
- Dramatic proportions desired
- Tool storage (small to large tools)
- Artistic statement pieces

### Practical Considerations

**Minimum Drawer Height:**
- Functional minimum: 2.5" - 3.0"
- Consider drawer slide clearances
- Account for drawer bottom thickness

**Maximum Drawer Height:**
- Avoid >12" unless necessary
- Heavy items in tall drawers are awkward
- Consider sub-dividing tall drawers

**Spacing Guidelines:**
- Standard: 0.5" - 0.75"
- Face-frame cabinets: 0.75" - 1.0"
- Frameless (European): 0.5"
- Must accommodate drawer slides

**Drawer Box Considerations:**
- Subtract 1" from face height for clearance
- Account for drawer bottom groove
- Consider dovetail/box joint height needs

### Common Drawer Counts

**3 Drawers** - Typical dresser, nightstand
- Golden ratio works perfectly
- Top: small items, Bottom: bulky items

**4 Drawers** - Standard chest of drawers
- Golden ratio or Fibonacci
- Good balance of sizes

**5-6 Drawers** - Tall dresser, lingerie chest
- Logarithmic prevents top drawers too small
- Consider breaking into two sections

**7+ Drawers** - Apothecary, tool chest
- Often uniform for interchangeable storage
- Or custom ratio for specific contents

## Example Projects

### Kitchen Base Cabinet (30" high, 4 drawers)
```
Settings:
- Total Height: 26" (allowing 4" for top frame)
- Drawer Count: 4
- Spacing: 0.75"
- Progression: Golden Ratio

Results:
1. Top: 4.1"    (cutlery, utensils)
2.      6.6"    (linens, towels)
3.      10.7"   (pots, pans)
4. Bottom: 17.3" (large pots, appliances)
```

### Office Desk (6" drawer space, 3 drawers)
```
Settings:
- Total Height: 5"
- Drawer Count: 3
- Spacing: 0.5"
- Progression: Arithmetic (0.5" increment)

Results:
1. Top: 1.25"   (pens, clips)
2.      1.75"   (papers, files)
3. Bottom: 2.0" (notebooks, supplies)
```
