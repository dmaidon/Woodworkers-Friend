# Wood Movement Calculator

## Overview
Wood expands and contracts with changes in humidity. This calculator helps you account for seasonal wood movement in your projects.

## Why Wood Moves
- Wood is hygroscopic - it absorbs and releases moisture
- Moisture content changes with seasonal humidity
- Movement is primarily across the grain
- Longitudinal (along grain) movement is minimal

## Required Inputs
- **Board Width**: Current width of the board (inches)
- **Initial Moisture Content**: Starting MC% (typically 6-8% for indoor furniture)
- **Final Moisture Content**: Expected MC% at destination
- **Wood Species**: Different species have different movement rates

## Understanding Results
The calculator shows:
- **Expected Movement**: Total expansion or contraction
- **Movement per Season**: Typical seasonal variation
- **Design Recommendations**: How to accommodate movement

## Design Strategies
- **Allow for Movement**: Use elongated holes, not round
- **Float Panels**: Panel should move freely in grooves
- **Grain Direction**: Glue joints should align grain direction
- **Breadboard Ends**: Pin only at center, allow ends to move

## Common Species Movement Rates
- **Stable**: Mahogany, Teak, Cedar
- **Moderate**: Oak, Maple, Walnut, Cherry
- **High Movement**: Beech, Hickory, Ash

## Critical Applications
- Tabletops and panels
- Frame and panel construction
- Wide glue-ups
- Joinery with cross-grain components

## Safety Note
Restricting wood movement can cause:
- Splitting
- Warping
- Joint failure
- Finish cracking

Always design projects to accommodate natural wood movement!
