# Best Practices

## Measurement Accuracy

### Taking Measurements
- Measure twice, cut once (the woodworker's golden rule)
- Use quality measuring tools (tape measure, square, calipers)
- Measure at multiple points to account for irregularities
- Write down measurements immediately
- Use consistent units throughout your project

### Working with Calculators
- Double-check your inputs before calculating
- Verify units match your measuring tools
- Round conservatively (err on the side of caution)
- Account for saw kerf and material removal
- Consider wood movement in final dimensions

## Material Selection

### Choosing Wood
- Select wood appropriate for the project's use
- Consider grain direction and stability
- Account for seasonal wood movement
- Match wood species to joinery methods
- Inspect lumber for defects before purchasing

### Material Preparation
- Acclimate wood to your shop environment (7-14 days)
- Check moisture content before machining
- Joint and plane to final thickness
- Allow glued panels to stabilize before use

## Project Planning

### Before You Start
1. Create detailed cut lists and dimensions
2. Calculate material quantities with 10-15% waste factor
3. Plan joinery methods appropriate to skill level
4. Consider grain direction in assembly
5. Review safety requirements for all operations

### Using Calculators Effectively
- Save common dimensions as presets
- Export calculations for reference during build
- Keep printed copies at workbench
- Update calculations as project evolves
- Document any deviations from plan

## Safety First

### Always Remember
- Wear appropriate safety equipment
- Keep work area clean and organized
- Ensure proper lighting
- Use sharp, well-maintained tools
- Never rush through operations
- Follow manufacturer's safety guidelines

### When Using Calculators
- Verify calculated dimensions are realistic
- Check that joinery proportions are sound
- Ensure adequate material strength
- Consider stress points in design
- Account for hardware specifications

## Quality Control

### During Construction
- Test joinery fit before glue-up
- Check square at every assembly stage
- Allow adequate drying time for finishes
- Inspect dimensions before final cuts
- Document lessons learned for future projects

### Documentation
- Save your calculations and presets
- Take photos of successful builds
- Note material sources and costs
- Record finish recipes and techniques
- Build a reference library of projects

## Working with Joinery

### Drawer Construction
- Test fit all joints before assembly
- Use consistent material thickness
- Account for drawer slide clearances
- Ensure square corners
- Sand components before assembly

### Door Making
- Calculate reveals carefully
- Consider hinge placement
- Allow for seasonal movement
- Test fit before finishing
- Use quality hardware

## Efficiency Tips

### Workflow Optimization
- Batch similar operations together
- Organize materials and tools before starting
- Use presets for repeated dimensions
- Keep calculator results accessible
- Minimize tool changes

### Time Management
- Allow adequate time for each operation
- Don't skip material preparation steps
- Factor in glue and finish drying times
- Plan for unexpected issues
- Schedule complex operations when fresh

## Continuous Improvement

### Learn and Adapt
- Review each project after completion
- Update presets with proven dimensions
- Document successful techniques
- Learn from mistakes
- Share knowledge with community

### Using This Application
- Explore all calculator features
- Experiment with different methods
- Create presets for common projects
- Export data for future reference
- Provide feedback for improvements

Remember: Precision in planning leads to success in execution. Use these calculators as tools to enhance your craftsmanship, not replace your judgment and experience.
