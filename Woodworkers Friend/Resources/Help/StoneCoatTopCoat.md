# Stone Coat Top Coat Calculator

## Purpose
Calculate precise amounts of Stone Coat Countertop epoxy top coat needed for kitchen counters, bar tops, and table surfaces. Stone Coat uses a unique water-based mixing formula.

## What is Stone Coat Top Coat?

**Stone Coat Countertops** produces a specialized epoxy top coat system designed for:
- Kitchen and bathroom countertops
- Bar tops and table surfaces  
- High-traffic horizontal surfaces
- UV-resistant, food-safe finishes

### Unique Features
- **Water-activated formula** - requires room temperature water in the mix
- **Two-part system** - Part A (resin) + Part B (hardener) + Water
- **Matte or Gloss finish** - different mixing ratios
- **Self-leveling** - flows to create perfectly smooth surface
- **Coverage**: Approximately **150-200 sq ft per gallon** at recommended thickness

## Using the Calculator

### Step 1: Calculate Total Area
Use the **Area Calculator** table to sum up all surfaces:
1. Enter dimensions (length × width) for each surface
2. Select calculation type:
   - **Pour**: For the base epoxy pour layer
   - **TopCoat**: For the Stone Coat top coat layer
   - **Both**: Calculate materials for both layers simultaneously
3. Total area displays automatically

### Step 2: Enter Area in Top Coat Section
- Total area from Area Calculator automatically populates
- Or manually enter **Total Area (SqFt)**

### Step 3: Select Waste Percentage
Choose based on experience and project complexity:
- **0%**: Exact calculation (experienced users, simple shapes)
- **10%**: Small projects, rectangular shapes
- **15%**: Standard recommendation for most projects
- **20%**: Complex shapes, first-time Stone Coat users

### Step 4: Review Mixing Instructions
The calculator displays **exact amounts** for:

#### Matte Finish
- Part A (ounces and ml)
- Part B (ounces and ml)  
- Room temperature water (ounces and ml)
- Total mixture volume

#### Gloss Finish
- Part A (ounces and ml)
- Part B (ounces and ml)
- Room temperature water (ounces and ml)
- Total mixture volume

## Stone Coat Mixing Ratios

### Matte Finish (Most Popular)
**Ratio: 2A : 1B : 0.5W**
- 2 parts Part A
- 1 part Part B
- 0.5 parts room temp water

*Example for 10 sq ft*:
- Part A: 7 oz (207 ml)
- Part B: 3.5 oz (104 ml)
- Water: 1.75 oz (52 ml)

### Gloss Finish (High Shine)
**Ratio: 2A : 1B : 0.35W**
- 2 parts Part A
- 1 part Part B
- 0.35 parts room temp water

*Example for 10 sq ft*:
- Part A: 7.5 oz (222 ml)
- Part B: 3.75 oz (111 ml)
- Water: 1.3 oz (38 ml)

## Top Coat Multiplier

The calculator uses **coverage rates** to determine material needed:
- **Base Coverage**: ~175 sq ft per gallon (manufacturer specification)
- **Multiplier adjusts** for:
  - Porous surfaces (need sealer coat first)
  - Texture depth
  - Desired thickness
  - Edge treatments

**Standard multiplier**: 0.7 oz per square foot (includes waste factor)

## Application Process

### Surface Preparation
1. **Clean thoroughly** - remove all dust, grease, oils
2. **Apply Stone Coat Primer** if surface is porous
3. **Allow primer to cure** - minimum 24 hours
4. **Light sand with 220 grit** - remove any bubbles or dust nibs
5. **Wipe with tack cloth** - ensure perfect cleanliness

### Mixing Procedure
1. **Measure Part A** precisely using scale or graduated container
2. **Add Part B** at exact ratio
3. **Mix for 2 minutes** - scrape sides and bottom thoroughly
4. **Add room temp water** slowly while mixing
5. **Mix for 3 more minutes** - ensure complete incorporation
6. **Let rest 2 minutes** - allows bubbles to rise
7. **Pour within 30 minutes** - work time is limited

### Application
1. **Pour in ribbons** across surface
2. **Spread with notched squeegee** - maintains consistent thickness
3. **Back-roll with foam roller** - removes air bubbles
4. **Torch surface lightly** - pops remaining bubbles (be careful!)
5. **Allow to self-level** - 45-60 minutes
6. **Cover to protect** from dust and debris

### Curing Time
- **Initial cure**: 24 hours (no contact)
- **Light use**: 48 hours  
- **Full cure**: 7 days (maximum hardness and chemical resistance)
- **Temperature affects cure speed**: 65-85°F optimal

## Area Calculator Integration

The **Area Calculator** (table at top of Epoxy tab) helps:
- **Track multiple surfaces** simultaneously
- **Separate pour vs. topcoat** calculations
- **Automatic totaling** of complex layouts

### Using Area Calculator
1. Click in grid to add new row
2. Enter surface name/description
3. Enter length and width
4. Select type: Pour, TopCoat, or Both
5. Area auto-calculates
6. Total displays at bottom

## Important Warnings

⚠️ **CRITICAL SAFETY:**

### Water Temperature
- **MUST be room temperature** (65-75°F)
- Cold water slows cure dramatically
- Hot water can cause flash cure or excessive heat

### Mixing Precision
- **Use scale or precise measuring** - eyeballing causes failures
- Stone Coat is sensitive to ratio errors
- Off-ratio mix may not cure properly or remain tacky

### Environmental Conditions
- **Temperature**: 65-85°F during application and cure
- **Humidity**: 30-70% relative humidity ideal
- **Ventilation**: Required but avoid fans blowing on surface
- **Dust control**: Critical - any debris ruins finish

### Common Mistakes
1. **Wrong water amount** - calculator shows EXACT amount needed
2. **Insufficient mixing** - must mix for full 5 minutes total
3. **Applying too thick** - thin coats are better than thick
4. **Re-coating too soon** - wait for full cure between coats
5. **Contaminated water** - use clean, filtered water only

## Tips for Success

### First-Time Users
- **Start with small project** - learn the material behavior
- **Use 20% waste factor** - better to have extra than run short
- **Practice mixing** on scrap surface first
- **Have all tools ready** before mixing - work time is limited

### Professional Results
- **Two thin coats** better than one thick coat
- **Sand between coats** with 400 grit for perfect adhesion
- **Wipe with alcohol** before second coat
- **Maintain consistent temperature** throughout cure
- **Protect from UV** during cure (can yellow if in direct sun)

### Cost Optimization
- Calculate precisely using calculator - reduces waste
- Buy appropriate kit size - larger kits cost less per oz
- Stone Coat kits typically in 1-gallon, 2-gallon, 3-gallon sizes
- One gallon covers ~175-200 sq ft at standard thickness

## Troubleshooting

### Top Coat Won't Level
- **Too cold**: Warm surface to 70-75°F
- **Mixed incorrectly**: Ensure exact ratios followed
- **Too thick**: Use recommended squeegee notch size

### Bubbles Won't Pop
- **Torch too far away**: Pass 6-8" above surface quickly
- **Torch too close**: Can burn or discolor - keep moving
- **Too many passes**: Can overheat and cause fish-eyes

### Tacky Surface After 24 Hours
- **Ratio error**: Most common cause - check mixing precision
- **Old hardener**: Part B has shelf life - check date
- **Contaminated water**: Use fresh, clean room-temp water
- **Too cold**: Cure temp below 65°F slows dramatically

### Uneven Coverage
- **Insufficient material**: Use calculator to ensure adequate supply
- **Application technique**: Spread evenly before self-leveling
- **Surface not level**: Check substrate with level before application

## Formula Reference

**Volume Calculation**:
```
Area (sq ft) × Thickness (inches) × 231 = Cubic inches
Cubic inches ÷ 231 = Gallons needed
```

**Stone Coat Matte Mix**:
```
Part A = Total Volume × 0.571  (57.1%)
Part B = Total Volume × 0.286  (28.6%)
Water  = Total Volume × 0.143  (14.3%)
```

**Stone Coat Gloss Mix**:
```
Part A = Total Volume × 0.595  (59.5%)
Part B = Total Volume × 0.298  (29.8%)
Water  = Total Volume × 0.107  (10.7%)
```
