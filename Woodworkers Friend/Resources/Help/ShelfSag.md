# Shelf Sag Calculator

## Overview
The Shelf Sag Calculator helps you determine the deflection of a shelf under load, ensuring your shelves are both safe and aesthetically pleasing.

## Required Inputs
- **Shelf Length**: Distance between supports (inches)
- **Shelf Width**: Front to back dimension (inches)
- **Shelf Thickness**: Material thickness (inches)
- **Load**: Total weight on the shelf (pounds)
- **Material**: Wood species (affects modulus of elasticity)

## How It Works
The calculator uses engineering formulas to compute the maximum deflection at the center of the shelf. This helps you:
- Ensure shelves won't sag excessively
- Choose appropriate materials and dimensions
- Determine if additional support is needed

## Tips
- Maximum acceptable sag is typically 1/360th of the span
- Hardwoods have higher stiffness than softwoods
- Thicker shelves resist sagging better
- Adding a middle support dramatically reduces sag

## Safety Note
Always include a safety factor in your calculations. The calculator provides theoretical values - real-world conditions may vary.
