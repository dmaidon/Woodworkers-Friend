# Table Tipping Force Calculator

## Overview
Calculate the force required to tip a table, helping you design stable furniture.

## What It Calculates

The minimum force (in pounds) needed to tip a table forward, based on:
- Table height
- Base width
- Table weight
- Load weight

## Physics

Uses moment (torque) calculations:
- Center of gravity
- Lever arm distances
- Tipping point analysis

## Required Inputs

- **Table Height**: Vertical dimension
- **Base Width**: Distance between legs
- **Table Weight**: Empty weight
- **Load Weight**: Items on top

## Results

- **Tipping Force**: Pounds needed to tip
- **Stability Rating**: Safe/Caution/Unstable
- **Recommendations**: Design improvements

## Design Guidelines

### Safe Tables
- Wide base relative to height
- Low center of gravity
- Heavy base weight
- Proper leg placement

### Warning Signs
- Tall with narrow base
- Top-heavy design
- Lightweight base
- Unstable on uneven floors

## Tips

- Lower center of gravity = more stable
- Wider base = harder to tip
- Add weight to base if needed
- Test before final assembly
