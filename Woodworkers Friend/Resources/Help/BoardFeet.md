# Board Feet Calculator

## Overview
Calculate lumber volume in board feet and estimate costs for your woodworking projects.

## What is a Board Foot?

A board foot is a volume measurement equal to:
- 1 inch thick × 12 inches wide × 12 inches long
- Or 144 cubic inches of wood

## Formula

**Board Feet = (Thickness × Width × Length) / 144**

Where all dimensions are in inches.

## Required Inputs

- **Thickness**: Actual thickness in inches (e.g., 0.75 for 3/4")
- **Width**: Board width in inches
- **Length**: Board length in inches
- **Quantity**: Number of boards
- **Price per Board Foot**: Cost per BF (optional)

## Example Calculation

**One board:**
- Thickness: 1 inch
- Width: 6 inches
- Length: 96 inches (8 feet)

**Calculation:**
(1 × 6 × 96) / 144 = 4 board feet

**If 10 boards at $3.50 per BF:**
- Total BF: 4 × 10 = 40 BF
- Total Cost: 40 × $3.50 = $140.00

## Common Lumber Sizes

### Standard Thicknesses
- 4/4 (1"): Actual 0.75"
- 5/4 (1.25"): Actual 1"
- 6/4 (1.5"): Actual 1.25"
- 8/4 (2"): Actual 1.75"

### Typical Widths
- 4", 6", 8", 10", 12"
- Random width boards vary

### Standard Lengths
- 6', 8', 10', 12', 14', 16'
- Convert to inches for calculation

## Tips

### Purchasing Lumber
- Order 10-15% extra for waste
- Check actual vs. nominal dimensions
- Price varies by species and quality
- Buy from reputable dealers

### Planning Projects
- Calculate BF needed for all parts
- Add waste factor for mistakes
- Consider grain matching
- Account for thickness loss in planing

### Cost Estimation
- Track prices by species
- Compare suppliers
- Buy in bulk when possible
- Consider transport costs
